    "# Flag Codes from Product Constructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates construction of flag codes from product constructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is a list of binary matrices which can be interpreted as 1-dimensional cell complexes or tanner graphs with columns corresponding to checks and rows corresponding to bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A product complex is generated and from this a flag graph. In the flag graph, flags are $c$-adjacent if they differ only by a cell of dimension $c$. Quantum codes are constructed by identifying checks with either:\n",
    "- **Maximal Subgraphs:** connected components of the flag graph where flags are $c_i$-adjacent for some $c_i$ in a set of 'colours' $\\mathbf{c} := \\{c_0,..,c_{d-1}\\}$.\n",
    "- **Rainbow Subgraphs:** subsets of flags $R$ where each flag $f$ is $c_i$ adjacent to a flag also in $R$ for each $c_i$ in a set of 'colours' $\\mathbf{c} := \\{c_0,..,c_{d-1}\\}$. Note that each rainbow subgraph is a subgraph of the corresponding maximal subgraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of the subgraph is the number of colours $d$ in $\\mathbf{c}$. We generally  associate Z-checks with 2-dimensional subgraphs and  X-checks with D-dimensional subgraphs where $D$ is the number of binary matrices in the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main constructions illustrated in this notebook:\n",
    "- **MSG:** both X-checks and Z-checks are maximal subgraphs - this corresponds to the construction in the Quantum Pin Codes paper; \n",
    "- **RSG:** X-checks of maximal type and Z-checks of rainbow type;\n",
    "- **Mixed:** X-checks and Z-checks of maximal type if the set of colours $\\mathbf{c}$ contains both $0$ and $D$, and rainbow type otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction method can be varied by changing the 'constrFun' input variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script verifies whether the code generated is Quasi-transversal (see Proposition 5 of the Quantum Pin Codes paper) - this would mean that the code has a diagonal logical operator at level 3 of the Clifford hierarchy which can be obtained by applying a series of T and CZ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also optionally:\n",
    "- Calculate the **Z-distance** of the code: set 'calc_dist=True';\n",
    "- Find the **coloured logical Pauli operators** (see Section IV.B of the Quantum Pin Codes paper): set 'coloured_logical_paulis=True';\n",
    "- Calculate a generating set of **diagonal logical operators** using the method in Transversal Diagonal Logical Operators for Stabiliser Codes: set 'calc_LO=True';\n",
    "- Perform **edge-contraction** of the flag graph which results in a higher encoding rate for some codes: set 'constrFun=Complex_to_8_24_48_Cell' or 'constrFun=Complex_to_24_Cell'."
