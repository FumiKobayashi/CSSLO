    "# Flag Codes from Tesselations of Manifolds\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the construction of flag codes from tilings of manifolds as described on page 3 of  Quantum Pin Codes by Vuillot and Breuckmann.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, the starting point is a cell complex corresponding to a tiling of a manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flags are created by selecting a sequence of cells of each dimension in which a the cell of dimension $c$ is contained in the cell of dimension $c+1$. In the flag graph, flags are $c$-adjacent if they differ only by a cell of dimension $c$. Quantum codes are constructed by identifying checks with connected components of the flag graph where flags are $c_i$-adjacent for some $c_i$ in a set of 'colours' $\\mathbf{c} := \\{c_0,..,c_{d-1}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of the subgraph is the number of colours $d$ in $\\mathbf{c}$. We generally  associate Z-checks with 2-dimensional subgraphs and  X-checks with D-dimensional subgraphs where $D$ is the dimension of the manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can select from a variety of 2D and 3D cell complexes which have been generated using a Gap script, and explore the effect of various types of edge-contractions to reduce the number of physical qubits."
